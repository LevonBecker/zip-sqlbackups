# Zip SQL Backups PowerShell Script

This script will zip files using 7-zip CLI and remove the files it compressed.
I creates the zip files in the same directory as the source files.
I created it for zipping up Microsoft SQL bak files and to be run as a scheduled task, but could be used for other compression purposes.
